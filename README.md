  This project aims to simulate a set of satellites orbiting the moon. In it we
  have two satellite prototypes whose purpose is to show mountainous regions and
  lunar craters, and their depths.

## Programming languages used

In this project we used the C and C ++ programming language, as well as Proteus software to simulate some electrical circuits. In addition, we use tools such as 3D printer and laser cutting machine to build the prototype. A PWM was also modulated in a Relay module for engine speed control.
